                    <p class="lead m-5">
                        Omar AlArifi is a 25-year-old health centre receptionist who enjoys watching YouTube videos, relaxing and adult colouring books. He is brave and considerate, but can also be very standoffish and a bit greedy.
            
                         He has a degree in medicine. He is allergic to shellfish. He is obsessed with Frozen.
                        
                        Physically, Omar is in pretty good shape. He is average-height with walnut skin, brown hair and black eyes. He has one or two distinguishing features including a mole on the end of his nose and a tattoo of Olaf between his shoulder blades.
                        
                        He is currently single. His most recent romance was with a legal secretary called Lia Christine O'Quinn, who was 11 years older than him. They broke up because Lia wanted somebody more intellectual.
                        
                        Omar's best friend is a health centre receptionist called Nicole Lee. They have a very firey friendship. He also hangs around with Damian Hamilton and Roland O'Brien. They enjoy spreading fake news on Facebook together.
